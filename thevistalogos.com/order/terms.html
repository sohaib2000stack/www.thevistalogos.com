          <h3>3. Order Process </h3>
          <p>3.1 Placing an Order. When filling in an Order form, it is the sole responsibility of the Client to
            register using a valid email address and to provide a correct phone number where the Client can be reached
            (preferably both - home and mobile). There may be multiple occasions during Order preparation when
            establishing contact with the Client is crucial. Failure to provide a valid email address or a correct phone
            number may affect Order completion and will result in a violation of the terms and conditions of this
            Agreement. This may lead to forfeiture of any claim to the implied warranty or guarantee by the Client.</p>
          <p>While using the account, the Client obliged to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Inform the Support right away in case of disclosure or possible disclosure of the password necessary to
              log in the account.</li>
            <li>The Client is accountable for every action made on his account until they close it or report its misuse
              by third parties.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The direct communication over the phone between the Client and the Resume Writer is prohibited by the
            Company. For that purpose, the Client is welcome to use the numerous interactive features created by the
            Company. For any questions and concerns, the Client can also contact a qualified Support Team available
            24/7.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term-text">
          <h3>3.2. Provided information </h3>
          <p>Information provided by the Client in Order description and in additional files needed for Order completion
            immediately becomes visible for the Resume Writers once Order is paid. The Company is not responsible for
            the information voluntarily disclosed by the Client when placing an Order and highly encourages the Client
            to avoid including any personal or billing information (i.e. Client's phone number, email address etc.) as
            well as disclosing the Client's identity when communicating with the Resume Writer through the Messaging
            System.</p>

        <div class="term-text">
          <h3>Discounts</h3>
          <p>A discount code cannot be used after the Order is placed. The Company is not obliged to replace the Order
            or compensate the difference in case the discount code is not used while placing the Order. Thus, the Client
            must be attentive and precise when filling the form and placing the Order.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term-text">
          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <p>As far as the Company works based on the Client's instructions, the latter must be full and precise. The
            Client is obliged to either fill in a survey with the information needed for Product Completion or provide
            an old Resume or CV for reference after the Order placement. The Client may also use both options to send
            all the necessary details.</p>
          <p>If the Client fails to provide the necessary information within the reasonable for the Order completion
            time period, the Company cannot fulfill any implied warranty or guarantee, and it shall not be held
            responsible.</p>
          <p>The Client is advised that once the Order is completed, any revision request must only be based on the
            initial requirements as well as description of the original Order. Any changes from the initial instructions
            of the Order will be considered as 'editing' which is an additional service of the Company. In this case,
            the Company will not conduct any free revision request that is different or deviates from the original Order
            requirements/description.</p>
          <p>Any additional instructions and requests must be sent before a Resume Writer is assigned to the Order.</p>
          <p>Failure to meet this requirement will result in violation of the given Agreement and forfeiture of any
            claim to the implied warranty or guarantee.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term-text">
          <h3>3.5. Sources</h3>
          <p>The Resume Writer has the right to use all the information provided by the Client. Also, the Resume Writer
            can use the Internet to understand better the instructions of the Client, the specifications of the Order,
            and comply the Order with the requirements of the job the Client want to apply, in case the Client has not
            provided this information himself.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term-text">
          <h3>3.6. Messaging System</h3>
          <p>The Messaging System is an easy and convenient way to communicate. The Client should check messages for any
            updates from the Support Team or from the Resume Writer. The Client should also promptly address any
            questions, concerns or give additional instructions using this interactive feature. Failure or neglect to
            check the Messaging System shall not be sufficient ground for a refund of services rendered. If the Client
            does not know how to use the Messaging System, the Client may contact the Support Team at any time for
            assistance or instruction by our toll free phone number or send an email.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term-text">
          <h3>3.7. Incorrect Order Placement</h3>
          <p>The Company reserves the right not to process or to resubmit the Client's Order in the event that the
            details indicated are inconsistent to or do not match the Order's original description. Failure to provide
            the correct description or choosing the wrong Product, deadline extension requests may require additional
            payments. Please note this is done by the Company only so that it may properly process the Client's Order
            and have the best possible Resume Writer to complete the Client's Order. The Client will always be contacted
            to approve any additional charges or requests.</p>

        <div class="term-text">
          <h3>3.8. Tracking Order Progress</h3>
          <p>The Client is highly encouraged to stay in touch with the Support Team/Resume Writer and to monitor Order
            Progress through the Client's personal account on the web site. Possible statuses of the Order are:</p>
          <ul>

              instructions.</li>

              stopped working on it. The Client is advised to visit Messaging board on the personal profile for detailed
