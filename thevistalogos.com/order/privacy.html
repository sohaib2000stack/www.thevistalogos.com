            that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive - to enable us to provide a more user-friendly
            service. Most web browsers are configured to automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your
            browser to prevent that, although this will detrimentally affect your use of our web sites as well as many
            others. You should note that, in order to measure performance, our advertising and affiliate partners, e.g.
            Google, may also make use of cookies and that we may have access to resulting data.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term-text">
          <h3>3rd Parties</h3>
          <p>We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, for example freelance
            consultants specializing in particular sectors or geographical territories. Such companies and individuals
            will have access to any personal information needed to perform these functions, but may not use it for any
            other purposes, and are required to handle your data in accordance with appropriate data protection
            legislation.</p>

          <p>Not one of our customers has ever reported fraudulent use of a credit or debit card as a result of
            purchases made with us. We are so confident about the transaction security we offer on our web sites that we
            back every purchase with a security guarantee: if your bank or card issuer holds you liable, we will give
            you a full refund, provided that the unauthorized use of your credit or debit card resulted through no fault
            of your own from purchases made while using our secure server.</p>

          <p>The uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security within its online order systems - widely acknowledged as the
            best available system for secure e-commerce trading - because we know that our clients want and need
            assurance that their personal information will be 100% safe. Before you provide sensitive and confidential
            data, you want proof that the website can be trusted and that your information will be encrypted and
            protected.</p>
          <p>The uses VeriSign for its SSL certification because they have issued more SSL Certificates than any other
            certificate authority. Their rigorous authentication practices set the standard for online identity
            assurance and are audited by KPMG.</p>
          <p>From time to time a notice may appear on your screen alerting you to the fact that you are moving from a
            secure server to one which is not secure. Do not be alarmed by this. Only in the secure part will we take
            personal or card details from you.</p>

          <p>Every transaction is encrypted to the highest global standards and all sensitive data is secured beyond the
            levels demanded by the payments authorities and card schemes. PayPal allows anyone with an email address to
            securely, conveniently and cost-effectively make payments online. You can pay using your credit card, debit
            card, or bank account. PayPal sends the money to us but never shares your financial information with us.</p>
